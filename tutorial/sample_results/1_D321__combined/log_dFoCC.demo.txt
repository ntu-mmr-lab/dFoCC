   Map from fft




 Input key words now


  EITHER
 CORRELATE SECTION - to calculate correlation section by section

  OR
 CORRELATE RESIDUE - to calculate correlation residue by residue

  OR
 CORRELATE ATOM    - to calculate correlation atom by atom

  OR
 REAL space R factor - calculated  residue by residue
 This requires Map1 = FC  
               Map2 = Fobs ( scaled to FC)
               Map3 = "Atom map" with residue flag

  OR
 MAP AVERAGE - average two maps and output new map


  OR
 MAP EXCLUDE - output map2 with points excluded if they  exist in map1 
 eg output solvent density after masking with FC from  protein coordinates.


  OR
 MAP INCLUDE - output map2 with points included only  if they exist in map1 
 eg output protein density after masking with FC from protein coordinates.


 Data line--- MAP ADD
  add two maps and output new map
 Scale for mapin1  1.0 scale for mapin2  1.0
 Data line---                 END

 Check print - Mode =    -2
